# Taplo IDE

This directory contains an LSP implementation for TOML documents.

Currently the LSP is tailored to run in a WASM environment, but it's not too dependent on it and the WASM parts can be easily replaced.

A Visual Studio Code client also exists in the [vscode](./vscode) directory along with the extension that bundles the server and the client together.
